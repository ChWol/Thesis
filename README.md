By Christopher Wolters in cooperation with Duke Center for Computational Evolutionary Intelligence 



## Installation steps (Linux)
1. Get the tool from GitHub
```
git clone
```

2. Set up hardware parameters in NeuroSim Core (Param.cpp) and compile the Code
```
make
```

3. Set up hardware constraints in Python wrapper (train.py)

4. Run Pytorch wrapper (integrated with NeuroSim)
```
python train.py --args
```
